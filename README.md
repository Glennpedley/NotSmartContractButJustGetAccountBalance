# NotSmartContractButJustGetAccountBalance
This is supposedly Smart Contract but actually end up more javascript to get balances of account on the blockchain net thingy

So, what I do? I go search everywhere like dog and try here and there.
In the end, just copy and paste here.

The files here.
web3.min.js is the web3 files.
html file is put the two buttons, one for eth main address balance and one more for the token whereby we use the token's contract address.
html file also links to the other js files.
the TokenBalance js file is the one running the requests.
the TokenABI js file is the one where the variable TokenABI is stored.... it is like a list of JSON stuff to send in the request made.
