# NotSmartContractButJustGetAccountBalance
This is supposedly Smart Contract but actually end up more javascript to get balances of account on the blockchain net thingy

So, what I do? I go search everywhere like dog and try here and there.
In the end, just copy and paste here.

The files here.<br>
web3.min.js is the web3 files.<br>
html file is put the two buttons, one for eth main address balance and one more for the token whereby we use the token's contract address.<br>
html file also links to the other js files.<br>
the TokenBalance js file is the one running the requests.<br>
the TokenABI js file is the one where the variable TokenABI is stored.... it is like a list of JSON stuff to send in the request made.<br>
